PlayGrounds
===========

This repository contains example implementations to help the author learn things in a quick way (;

Actually, the first playground project was setting up this PlayGrounds repository.
In order to have a better understanding of git and it's useful ways to handle different projects,
the author decided to dive into the world of git's subtree feature. Every project, which is a PlayGround
project, will be merged into this repository. This also allows one to clone every PlayGround project
just by cloning this PlayGrounds repository.
